\begin{block}{GDP}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item BVAR is best at short horizon, though dfm is quite close
	\item dfm is much better at longer horizons
	\item lstm does poorly
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


\begin{exampleblock}{features}
		\begin{itemize}
	\item dfm $>>$ BVAR $>>$ lstm
	\item paradox: dfm does well for features (not intended), and worse than BVAR for gdp (dfm main target)
	\item explanation: dfm trains at monthly frequency for features, quarterly frequency for gdp: less accurate! 
\end{itemize}
